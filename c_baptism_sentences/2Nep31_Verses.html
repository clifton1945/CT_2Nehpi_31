<h1>The Second Book of Nephi Chapter 31 by Sentences.</h1>
<h3>Nephi tells why <span class="JC">Holy Ghost</span> was <span class="bap"><span class="bap">baptized</span></span>—Men must follow <span class="JC">Holy Ghost</span>, be <span class="bap">baptized</span>, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end to be saved—Repentance and <span class="bap">baptism</span> are the gate to the strait and narrow path—Eternal life comes to those who keep the commandments after <span class="bap">baptism</span>.  About 559–545 B.C.</h3>

    <p>1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>2 Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which i must speak concerning the doctrine of christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.
    </p>
    <p>3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.
    </p>
    <p>4 Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should <span class="bap">baptize</span> the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.
    </p>
    <p>5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be <span class="bap">baptized</span> by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be <span class="bap">baptized</span>, yea, even by water!
    </p>
    <p>6 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being <span class="bap">baptized</span> by water?
    </p>
    <p>7 Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.
    </p>
    <p>8 Wherefore, after he was <span class="bap">baptized</span> with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.
    </p>
    <p>9 And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.
    </p>
    <p>10 And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?
    </p>
    <p>11 And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be <span class="bap">baptized</span> in the name of my Beloved Son.
    </p>
    <p>12 And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is <span class="bap">baptized</span> in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.
    </p>
    <p>13 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of <span class="JC">Christ</span>, by <span class="bap">baptism</span>—yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the <span class="bap"><span class="bap">baptism</span></span> of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>14 But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the < class="bap">baptism</span of water, and have received the <span class="bap">baptism</span> of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.
    </p>
    <p>15 And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
    </p>
    <p>16 And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.
    </p>
    <p>17 Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and <span class="bap">baptism</span> by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>18 And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.
    </p>
    <p>19 And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of <span class="JC">Christ</span> with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.
    </p>
    <p>20 Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in <span class="JC">Christ</span>, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of <span class="JC">Christ</span>, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.
    </p>
    <p>21 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of <span class="JC">Christ</span>, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end.
    </p><p>Amen.
