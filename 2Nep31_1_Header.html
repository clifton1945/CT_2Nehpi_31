    <h1>The Second Book of Nephi Chapter 31:  No sentences </h1>
    <h2>-- baptism hi-lighted by hardcoded spans.</h2>

    <h3>Nephi tells why <span class="JC">Christ</span> was <span class="bap">baptized</span>—Men must follow <span class="JC">Christ</span>, be <span class="bap">baptized</span>, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end to be saved—Repentance and <span class="bap">baptism</span> are the gate to the strait and narrow path—Eternal life comes to those who keep the commandments after <span class="bap">baptism</span>.  About 559–545 B.C.</h3>
