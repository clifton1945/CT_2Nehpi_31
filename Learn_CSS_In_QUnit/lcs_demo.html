<h1> CSS Positioning </h1>

<p id="1">1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.
</p>
<p id="2">2 Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which i must speak concerning the doctrine of christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.
</p>
<p id="3">3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.
</p>
<p id="4">4 Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should <span class="bap">baptize</span> the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.
</p>
<p id="5">5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be <span class="bap">baptized</span> by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be <span class="bap">baptized</span>, yea, even by water!
</p>
<p id="6">6 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being <span class="bap">baptized</span> by water?
