<h1>How CSS Positioning Works</h1>

<p>1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.
</p>
<p>2 Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which i must speak concerning the doctrine of christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.
</p>
<p>3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.
</p>
<p>4 Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should <span class="bap">baptize</span> the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.
</p>
<p>5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be <span class="bap">baptized</span> by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be <span class="bap">baptized</span>, yea, even by water!
</p>
<p>6 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being <span class="bap">baptized</span> by water?
</p>
<p>7 Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.
</p>
<p>8 Wherefore, after he was <span class="bap">baptized</span> with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.
</p>
<p>9 And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.
</p>
<p>10 And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?
</p>
<p>11 And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be <span class="bap">baptized</span> in the name of my Beloved Son.
</p>

<div id="iAmFixed">
    <p>12 And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is <span class="bap"><span class="bap">baptized</span></span> in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.
    </p>
    <p>13 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of <span class="JC">Christ</span>, by <span class="bap"><span class="bap">baptism</span></span>â€”yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the <span class="bap"><span class="bap">baptism</span></span> of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.
