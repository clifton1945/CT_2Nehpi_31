    <p>1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren.
        <br>And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass;
        <br>neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.
    </p>

    <p>2 Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which i must speak concerning
        the doctrine of christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.
    </p>

    <p>3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men.
        <br>For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language,
        unto their understanding.
    </p>

    <p>4 Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord
        showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.
    </p>

    <p>5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all
        righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!
    </p>

    <p>6 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being
        baptized by water?
    </p>

    <p>7 Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that,
        according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be
        obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.
    </p>

    <p>8 Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the <span class="HG">Holy Ghost</span> descended upon him in the
        form of a dove.
    </p>

    <p>9 And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by
        which they should enter, he having set the example before them.
