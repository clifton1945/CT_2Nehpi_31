<h3>Nephi tells why <span class="JC">Christ</span> was baptized—Men must follow <span class="JC">Christ</span>, be baptized, receive the <span class="HG">Holy Ghost</span>, and endure to the end to be saved—Repentance and baptism are the gate to the strait and narrow path—Eternal life comes to those who keep the commandments after baptism.  About 559–545 B.C.</h3>
