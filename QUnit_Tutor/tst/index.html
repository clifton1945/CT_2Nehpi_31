    <p>1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren.
    </p><p>And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass;
    </p><p>neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>2 Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which i must speak concerning the doctrine of Holy Ghost; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.
    </p>
